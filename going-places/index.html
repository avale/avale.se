                It’s late september in the Swedish laplands and we scooch up around a campfire. It’s cold. Hot chocolate warms a bit, but never the less – it’s <em>cold</em>.
                Between our sips of warmth we acknowledge that it’s quite strange why we hold these hours so dearly. We’re sleeping in a tent and we know that frost will join
                us during the night. In the morning, we still won’t have any coverage on our phones. Our breakfast will be made out of <em>knäckebröd</em> and herring in tomato sauce.
                As far away from a hotel brunch you can get that is, but we can’t think of a better way to spend our time away from home. This <em>is</em> luxury.
            </p>

            <div class="divider"></div>

            <p>
                Nature brings us something that the city never can. A sense of calmness perhaps, or just the time to breath and think. Or time to breath and <em>not</em> think.
                Perhaps it doesn’t matter why it works – just that it does. We love to go places, and it’s clear that we love it more than we love our gear, our brunches and the
                daily hustles in the city we leave behind.
            </p>

            <div class="divider"></div>

            <p>
                Meanwhile, a lot of people find it to big of a hurdle to get out in nature. Outdoor brands scream technicalities; 6000 mm water proof shell jackets, a tent for 1500
                bucks and pants with no less than ten pockets. Not that you would want to carry your stuff in your pants – backpack, eh? – but still: don’t you dare get close to nature
                without having the right gear.
            </p>

            <div class="divider"></div>

            <p>
                This is so wrong. You don’t need all this gear to meet nature. You don’t need to reach a summit to meet nature. You don’t need to go abroad to meet nature.
            </p>

            <h3>You only need to meet nature.</h3>

            <p>
                Our promise is to help you do that, and we’ll keep you warm and dry while you’re at it. In the spring of 2018 we’ll launch a combined base and mid layer set.
                The set can be worn as a base layer for colder conditions, and during a hike in warmer conditions you can use the sweater as a mid layer – or even an only layer.
                It won’t have ten pockets, but it will be bullshit proof. And you will go places in it.
            </p>

                Needless to say, we know that we might be on a kamikaze mission here. The space is crowded – with so many outdoor brands out there. Some have told us to back out
                while we still can. We won’t. Our message is the same as it was by the campfire; to us – the action is the juice.
